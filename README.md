# LearningJAVA
- In this repo I am uploading java code what I am learning. If you want to add any code or suggestions to my code. Just feel free to fork this repository.
- All the code files are stored in src folder.
- You can just simply put this repository to your IntelliJ and directly run all the code files.

## Let's Talk about Java...
- Java is highly used in banks and Enterprise applications, Java's capability to compile one and run anywhere makes it very useful.
- Java is open source and various companies have created their own java by doing some modifications.
- Some of the known companies which provide Java are Oracle, IBM and Amazon.
- LTS Version - "Long Term Supported" versions which are stable version and have long term support available.
- Amazon Correto is one of the stable and tested java versions, I will be using to Learn.
- JDK - JDK(Java Development Kit) is like SDK(Software development kit), It is a cross-platformed software development environment that offers a collection of tools and libraries necessary for developing Java-based software applications.
- JVM - JVM(Java Virtual Machine) acts as a run-time engine to run Java applications, It understands machine code, A Java virtual machine is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. JVM is the one, which provides the java facility to compile one and run it anywhere.
- JVM is built on CPP, As CPP has the capability to directly interact with real hardware. Because JVM needs to interact with real hardware to execute our byte code.
- JAVAC is the compiler for JAVA which we get from JDK.
- JRE - JRE (Java Runtime engine) is the one that runs the byte code in JVM.
- Java Executable file(byte code) has the extension of ".class".
